Tapon app Mod 3000K free coins Hacks unlock all reading books guide - Don't be predicted. If you want to escape from enemies with bushes and have enough space for movement, try not to run in a straight line. A high-risk, high reward action you can take is to run in the opposite direction, but only to run past. This is only effective when the bushes are large enough to allow you to pass over your opponent while estimating their whereabouts. Do not click the fire button. When you hide, you are more likely to hit the bucket than others. Of course, unless that's your intention. Aim at the target and wait for the opponent to enter the shooting range.
